          After working within technology in higher education, I developed an
          interest in programming and completed the University of North Carolina
          - Chapel Hillâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. With excellent attention to detail
          and organizational skills, I am dedicated to building original and
          efficient web applications from start to finish with proficient skills
          in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy being challenged and working
          outside of my comfort zone. Looking for the perfect match with a
          company that will test and further my knowledge of web development.
